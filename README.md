I spend most of my time in the crypto exchanges and the world of software development. I decided to combine these areas where I spend the majority of my time by developing bots and projects that will help you gather data related to cryptocurrencies. Although I'm still a beginner in this field, I believe that my beginner to intermediate-level bots can be helpful to you.
